## Graph Embedded Convolutional Neural Networks in Human Crowd Detection for Drone Flight Safety

In this repository we provide the trained model for Crowd Detection in drone-captured images of our paper "Graph Embedded Convolutional Neural Networks in Human Crowd Detection for Drone Flight Safety". We provide an example of crowd heatmap generation utilizing the proposed model in heatmap_generation.py. A ROS node for crowd detection is provided in CrowdDetector.py. \
The utilized videos for the construction of the Crowd-Drone dataset are available at:
